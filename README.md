## Done Definition

From Moodle: "If your definition is simply of the form, "We are done when we code all of the rules," we already know that definition will be useless, whether it is one sentence or ten pages long. We need to consider the bigger picture and BVA gives us the tools to do exactly that. Think like a software engineer as you work on this milestone. A valid definition of done will require extensive reflection on the edge cases for the rules of your game."
